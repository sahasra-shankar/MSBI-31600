# MSBI-31600: Advanced Concepts in Computer Programming
## Prof. Jason Edelstein

### Homework Assignment 1-
This assignment consists of three coding questions:
  1) Build a unique object class called Macro aka Macromolecule that had a child class and grandchild class inheriting from it (Protein and Nucleotide).
  Setters and getters were implemented within the class appropriately to access or modify certain attributes
  
  2) Create two comprehensions-- one that only kept integers from the user input that were perfect squares and the other that got the average of a list of integers-- and then wrote each as a lambda function
  
  3) Two sets of code: one to get the dot product of two random 2x2 integer matrices and another to sort a random list of random lists. Each was timed and then optimized to be more efficient and timed again (using the timeit module).
